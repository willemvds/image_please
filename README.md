# ImagePlease
Image, Please!

## Roadmap
- Load image from cmdline args.
- Navigate between images and directories.
- Build image index by peeking at file headers instead of fully loading through SDL.
- Create an Edit mode in addition to default View mode.
- Provide a smooth and consistent cross platform experience.
